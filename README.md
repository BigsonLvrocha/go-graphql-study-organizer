This example is meant to show a full implementation of the server using an SQL datastore. 

### Starting

start the server, if you don't have the sqlite library already installed from gorm, then it 
may take a while to compile it

```
go run *.go
```

and then visit the GraphiQL dev server at `localhost:8080`
